      <h1 class="header main-header">Republic Act No. 9208</h1>
      <p class="question">
        This expert system will cover the Republic act No. 9208, also known as
        the "Anti-Trafficking in Persons Act of 2003," was enacted on May 26,
        2003, to address the growing issue of human trafficking in the
        Philippines, particularly the trafficking of women and children. This
        law aims to eliminate trafficking by establishing policies and
        institutional mechanisms to protect and support victims. It sets out
        penalties for individuals involved in trafficking and outlines the
        responsibilities of the government and other entities in preventing
        trafficking, ensuring the recovery and reintegration of victims, and
        prosecuting offenders. RA 9208 represents a significant step in the
        Philippines' commitment to combating human trafficking and upholding the
        rights and welfare of vulnerable individuals.
